            <h2>Overview of "Vatican II: The Battle for Meaning"</h2>
            <p>
                The book "Vatican II: The Battle for Meaning" by Massimo Faggioli explores the ongoing debate surrounding 
                the interpretation and reception of the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). Faggioli argues that the Council 
                was an epoch-making event whose significance is still being contested within the Catholic Church.
            </p>
            <p>
                The book is structured to guide the reader through the history of these debates, the various theological 
                schools of thought that emerged, and the key controversies that define the post-conciliar era. Rather than 
                presenting a single interpretation, Faggioli illuminates the complex landscape of competing narratives 
                about what Vatican II meant and continues to mean for the Catholic Church.
            </p>
            <p>
                This study examines how the Council has been understood from the time of its conclusion to the early 21st century, 
                covering periods of initial reception, enforcement under different pontificates, and the scholarly 
                "historicization" that has shaped contemporary understanding.

                    The theological debates of Vatican II were driven by brilliant and often opposing thinkers. These theologians 
                    served as the chief architects of the competing narratives that continue to shape Catholic thought today.
